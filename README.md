# Hey there!

Thanks for visiting my profile!

I'm Arek, Junior Fullstack Developer made in PolandðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, currently based in SpainðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.

My journey with software development began when I was managing my marketplace for healthy food delivery. During that time, I had the opportunity to observe how the platform was created and gradually fell in love with software development. At the beginning of 2022, I finally decided to make a career shift and take a step towards becoming a software developer.
